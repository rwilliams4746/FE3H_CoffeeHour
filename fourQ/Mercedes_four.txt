Asking to stay a bit longer
"Blush", "Sip Tea"
Bringing a cake
"Nod", "Sip Tea"
The cathedral being relaxing
"Blush", "Disagree"
Living in a quiet and beautiful church
"Commend"
Not regretting the choices I've made
"Commend", "Praise"
Putting flowers in the window
"Commend", "Nod"
Using you as a drawing model
"Blush", "Commend", "Nod"
Writing to my mother soon
"Chat", "Nod", "Praise"
