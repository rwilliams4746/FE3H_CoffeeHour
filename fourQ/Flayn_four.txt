A wave of nostalgia washing over me when I look at you
"Laugh", "Sip Tea"
Being born in Enbarr
"Nod"
Desiring to see the ocean again
"Chat", "Disagree", "Nod"
Have you any idea how many types of fish there are
"Blush", "Commend"
Having a fear of sleeping
"Disagree", "Praise"
Lively places are my favority
"Nod"
Promising you will stay near
"Blush", "Laugh","Nod"
We should take care of each other
"Nod"
Not seeming to know much about yourself
"Disagree", "Nod"
