Being so easy to talk to
"Admonish", "Laugh"
Cleaning my room too
"Disagree", "Nod"
Everyone being so serious all the time
"Laugh", "Nod"
Going on a trip together sometime
"Blush", "Laugh", "Nod"
Have you ever cried
"Sip Tea"
Knowing I'll always be safe by your side
"Chat", "Nod"
Loving hearing myself talk
"Nod", "Sip Tea"
My mind keeps drifting today
"Laugh", "Nod"
Wishing I could stay here and chat all day
"Laugh", "Praise"
