Beginning to feel more comfortable talking to people
"Disagree", "Nod"
Hoping you never leave me
"Blush", "Laugh"
Meeting misfortune spending too much time with me
"Admonish", "Chat", "Disagree"
Not knowing what to say
"Chat", "Praise"
Not like I can go home
"Chat", "Praise"
Spending time with me must be boring
"Admonish", "Disagree"
Thinking I can look forward to living my life
"Commend", "Laugh", "Nod"
Wasting time spent with me
"Disagree"
You don't seem to be very good at talking
"Nod", "Sigh"
