Enjoying a bit of fishing
"Nod"
Faerghus being a nation of proud knights
"Nod"
I am an unforgivable sinner
"Disagree", "Praise"
Mastered most things worth mastering
"Nod"
Not even the goddess will bring me to justice
"Praise", "Sigh"
Relaxing is not a skill I possess
"Laugh", "Praise"
Serving the royal family for decades
"Nod", "Sigh"
Strength alone does not make you powerful
"Chat"
Walking first thing in the morning
"Nod"
