Being exhausted by al my incessant thoughts
"Laugh", "Nod", "Sip Tea"
Believing in ghosts
"Chat", "Laugh"
Feeling there's a lot I can learn from you
"Blush", "Laugh"
Finding pleasure eating sweets
"Laugh", "Nod"
Lightening up from time to time
"Admonish", "Chat", "Praise"
Not putting energy into things that won't yield results
"Admonish", "Chat"
Thinking I woulnd't be who I am today without you
"Disagree", "Laugh"
The world might've been peaceful without Crests
"Chat", "Praise", "Sigh"
Wondering what I'd do if I gave up everything for my freedom
"Chat", "Nod"
