Baking us a cake
"Laugh", "Nod"
Breaking a plate again
"Chat", "Disagree", "Praise"
Cleaning with all your might
"Nod"
Feeling like I can be myself
"Blush", "Laugh"
Going to the confectioner
"Nod"
Helping with an equation
"Commend", "Nod", "Praise"
No effort ever being in vain
"Chat", "Commend", "Praise"
Spending time with you
"Laugh", "Nod"
About the first time I met you
"Blush", "Laugh"
