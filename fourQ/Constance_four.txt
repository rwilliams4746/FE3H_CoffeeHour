Aiding the restoration of House Nuvelle
"Nod", "Praise", "Sip Tea"
Born and raised on the western edge of Adrestia
"Nod", "Sigh"
Comeback must be earned through achievement
"Commend", "Nod", "Praise"
Wishing to know the secret of House Nuvelle
"Chat", "Disagree", "Sigh"
The field of magic brimming with mysteries
"Nod", "Praise"
Tea parties were once commonplace
"Laugh", "Praise"
Being wistful for the people I knew underground
"Chat", "Sigh"
Dagdan army took House Nuvelle's territory
"Disagree", "Praise", "Sigh"
Nothing standing in our way
"Chat", "Laugh", "Sip Tea"
