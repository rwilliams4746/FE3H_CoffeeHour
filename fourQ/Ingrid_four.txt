Being envious of the Monastery
"Chat", "Praise"
Calming my nerves
"Blush", "Disagree"
Forgetting about fighting for a moment
"Laugh", "Praise"
Having a meal with me
"Admonish", "Laugh"
Speaking with you
"Blush", "Disagree"
Spending so much time with my horse
"Admonish", "Laugh"
Starting sword training
"Chat"
Thinking of my next meal
"Laugh"
Your favorite food
"Chat", "Laugh"
