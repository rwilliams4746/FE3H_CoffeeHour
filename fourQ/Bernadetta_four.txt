Being recluses together
"Chat", "Laugh"
Bringing her sewing kit
"Nod"
Eavesdropping on my singing
"Nod", "Praise"
Hiding out in the greenhouse
"Nod"
My mother being a genius
"Commend", "Laugh"
My room in the Monastery
"Admonish", "Disagree", "Laugh"
The room needing more cuteness
"Admonish", "Laugh"
Spoiling me
"Admonish", "Praise"
Being worried about punishment
"Admonish"
