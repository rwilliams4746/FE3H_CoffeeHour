Feeling better here with you
"Nod", "Praise"
Feeling stronger affection when you may die tomorrow
"Chat", "Nod"
Being glad to have met you
"Blush"
Having enough money to live on for all our days
"Blush", "Praise"
Nobles making a pilgrimage to Garreg Mach
"Commend"
Not being a fan of hymns
"Chat", "Sigh"
Not having any weaknesses
"Disagree", "Sip Tea"
Not judging me for living how I want to
"Blush", "Laugh", "Sip Tea"
Vain men's lies never lasting
"Chat", "Sip Tea"
