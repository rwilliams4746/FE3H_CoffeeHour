A new gambit
A word of advice
Books you've read recently
Cats
Children at the market
Close calls
Exploring the Monastery
Fodlan's future
Forest birds
Gardening mishaps
Hopes for your future
I heard some gossip
Likeable allies
Monastery mysteries
Our first meeting
Overcoming weaknesses
Plans for the future
Relaxing at the Sauna
School days
Strange fish in the pond
Tell me about yourself
Thanks for everything
The existence of Crests
The ideal professor
The last battle
The Library's collection
The view from the bridge
You seem different
