# FE3H_CoffeeHour

## Inspiration
I designed this project to be an assistant to when I play Fire Emblem: Three Houses, since I am abysmal at its quick response, conversation based 'Tea Time' minigame.
## What it does
To successfully complete the minigame, you must select a character, and have three to four successful "conversations" (picking the right topic out of three before the ten second timer runs out). My program, "Coffee Hour", has every possible response for the 39 playable characters. By typing a portion of the topic out, displays all possible responses with that portion contained. 
## How I built it
The program runs solely on Java and is displayed through a JFrame. I created over 80 text files for this project since the hackathon started.
## Challenges I ran into
The algorithm was the simplest part. One, I've never used JFrame before until now, and its graphics and JPanel options are, quite frankly, disappointing. Two, with 80 text files comes time-consuming typos, and each one I had to type by hand since the fan-made charts were filled with typos and not set up for web-scraping. The same goes for the images as well- every one needed to be resized to a standard .png ratio.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I finished it! And learned JFrame fairly well as well.
## What I learned
I should work in a team next time, if only to save my sanity.
## What's next for Coffee Hour
Adding more functionality to the "Gift Options" section, and implementing an affinity chart for all 39 characters!
